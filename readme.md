Lead Software Developer
Assignment 1:
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to rapidly develop functional systems using
modern tools, while demonstrating a deep understanding of scalable and resilient architecture.
Rather than simply building a website, we’re interested in how you approach problem-solving,
make technical decisions, and leverage domain knowledge effectively.
We encourage you to use AI, open-source libraries, and existing codebases—but the key
evaluation criteria will be your choices and the reasoning behind them.
Do not hold back in HLD and your suggestions


Ask yourself:
● Why did you choose this particular tool or framework?
● How does your architecture support scalability and resilience?
● In what ways have you optimized for rapid development without sacrificing quality?
● How do your decisions reflect real-world constraints and priorities?

Techstack to be used :
1.Frontend : Any JavaScript Framework - [React.js]
2.BackEnd : Any fast development Framework -[Node.js]
3.Architecture - Cloud [AWS]

Problem Statement :

1. LLD[Fully Functional Webpage] :
    a. Create a Shopping Cart Website with
        i. Product Browse
        ii. Shopping Basket
        iii. Checkout Process [No Payment Required]
        iv. Wallet Implementation .
2.
    a. Components Required in a Architecture Diagram - Visual Representation
    b. Propose Optimizations using available AWS tools. - Visual Representation
    c. Deployment Choices - WriteUp

Constraints:

    1. Make sure the LLD code is well structured and readable[eg : integrations in one place ,Usage
       of Constants and maintain secrets] . - send a video to analyse the code structure and show few
       snippet to understand your flow of ideas.
    2. Use Integrations with AWS services and no dummy response , you can use AI to create DataSets.
    3. Explain the choice of Auth for Integration and how it makes your app fast /Secure
    4. Point out[Can be just a doc explaining] or implement guard rails in places to make sure
       we are safe at time of Service Degradation
    5. Explain [Can also be a writeup ] how you are gonna identify bottlenecks and collect
       metric to be effective for service Level SLAs

Assignment 2:

Assignment Scenario: Troubleshooting Under Pressure – A Real-World Leadership

Challenge: Welcome to your first real test as the new technical lead at GuisedUp. Since its successful release in March, the GuisedUp app has been performing well. TheMarketing team recently launched an intensive user acquisition campaign, and everything
seemed to be going according to plan—until Day 4. Suddenly, users begin reporting a critical issue: they are unable to receive OTPs during registration, effectively blocking new sign-ups at the height of your growth push.
As the new lead, it's your responsibility to take charge and resolve this fast. This isn’t just about fixing a bug—it’s about showcasing your ability to lead under pressure, think critically, and make smart, informed decisions that restore trust and performance.

Your Task:
Describe your approach to identifying and resolving this issue. Go beyond surface-level fixes and walk us through:

● How would you triage the situation and communicate with stakeholders?
● What tools, logs, or systems would you rely on to trace the root cause?
● How would you differentiate between infrastructure, code, and third-party service failures?
● Once the issue is identified, how would you ensure a fix that’s both immediate and future-proof?
● What preventative strategies would you implement to avoid similar outages?
