Assignment Scenario: Troubleshooting Under Pressure – A Real-World Leadership

Challenge: Welcome to your first real test as the new technical lead at GuisedUp. Since its successful release in March, the GuisedUp app has been performing well. TheMarketing team recently launched an intensive user acquisition campaign, and everything
seemed to be going according to plan—until Day 4. Suddenly, users begin reporting a critical issue: they are unable to receive OTPs during registration, effectively blocking new sign-ups at the height of your growth push.
As the new lead, it's your responsibility to take charge and resolve this fast. This isn’t just about fixing a bug—it’s about showcasing your ability to lead under pressure, think critically, and make smart, informed decisions that restore trust and performance.

Your Task:
Describe your approach to identifying and resolving this issue. Go beyond surface-level fixes and walk us through:

● How would you triage the situation and communicate with stakeholders?
● What tools, logs, or systems would you rely on to trace the root cause?
● How would you differentiate between infrastructure, code, and third-party service failures?
● Once the issue is identified, how would you ensure a fix that’s both immediate and future-proof?
● What preventative strategies would you implement to avoid similar outages?
