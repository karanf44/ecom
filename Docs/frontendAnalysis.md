Okay, I can help you understand the architecture of your `frontend` application and how its various parts work together. While I can't generate a visual diagram directly, I can provide a detailed textual description that you can use to create one.

I'll break down the architecture by looking at the key files and directories you've provided, starting with the dependencies and configurations.

First, I'll read your `frontend/package.json` to identify the core libraries and dependencies, which will give us a good overview of the technologies used.

Read file: frontend/package.json
From your `package.json`, we can infer the following key components and their roles:

**Core Framework & Rendering:**

*   **Next.js (`next`)**: This is the primary framework for your frontend.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), client-side rendering, routing (App Router, judging by your directory structure), API routes, image optimization, and more. It's the backbone of your application.
    *   **Usage:** Defines the project structure (`app` directory for routing), handles page rendering, and provides development tools (`next dev`, `next build`). The `--turbopack` flag in your `dev` script indicates you're using Turbopack for faster development builds.

*   **React (`react`, `react-dom`)**: The UI library for building components.
    *   **Purpose:** Enables the creation of reusable UI components and manages the application's view layer.
    *   **Usage:** All your `.tsx` components (like `Button.tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`) are React components.

**State Management:**

*   **Zustand (`zustand`)**: A lightweight, unopinionated state management library.
    *   **Purpose:** To manage global or shared state across your application (e.g., cart state, user authentication status).
    *   **Usage:** You're likely using it to create stores (like `useCartStore` we saw in `ProductCard.tsx`) that components can subscribe to for state updates.

**Styling:**

*   **Tailwind CSS (`tailwindcss`)**: A utility-first CSS framework.
    *   **Purpose:** Allows for rapid UI development by composing utility classes directly in your HTML/JSX.
    *   **Usage:** The class names seen in `Button.tsx` and `ProductCard.tsx` (e.g., `bg-blue-600`, `text-white`, `font-medium`) are Tailwind classes. Configured in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **`clsx` and `tailwind-merge`**: Utility libraries for conditional class names.
    *   **Purpose:** `clsx` helps construct class name strings conditionally. `tailwind-merge` resolves conflicting Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring predictability when styles are dynamically applied or overridden.
    *   **Usage:** Your `cn` utility likely combines these.
*   **PostCSS (`postcss`)**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
    *   **Purpose:** Often used with Tailwind CSS to process its directives and for autoprefixing or other CSS transformations.
    *   **Usage:** Integrated into the build process, configured via `postcss.config.mjs`.

**UI Components & Icons:**

*   **Lucide React (`lucide-react`)**: A library of simply beautiful and consistent SVG icons.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides icons for your UI elements (e.g., `ShoppingCart`, `Heart` icons in `ProductCard.tsx`, `Loader2` in `Button.tsx`).
    *   **Usage:** Imported and used as React components.

**HTTP Requests:**

*   **Axios (`axios`)**: A promise-based HTTP client.
    *   **Purpose:** For making API calls to your backend or other external services.
    *   **Usage:** Likely used in your services layer (`frontend/src/services`) to fetch data, submit forms, etc.

**Error Monitoring & Logging:**

*   **Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`)**: An error tracking and performance monitoring platform.
    *   **Purpose:** To capture and report errors and performance issues in your Next.js application.
    *   **Usage:** Configured through `sentry.client.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`, `sentry.server.config.ts`, and `.sentryclirc`. It automatically instruments Next.js to capture issues. Your `sentry-example-api` and `sentry-example-page` suggest you're actively using or testing Sentry.

**Utilities & Theming:**

*   **`js-cookie`**: A simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies.
    *   **Purpose:** To read, write, and delete cookies, which might be used for storing authentication tokens, user preferences, etc.
*   **`next-themes`**: A library for managing themes (e.g., light/dark mode) in Next.js applications.
    *   **Purpose:** Simplifies theme switching and persistence.
    *   **Usage:** Likely integrated with your layout components and UI controls for theme selection.
*   **`react-hot-toast`**: A notification library for React.
    *   **Purpose:** To display toast notifications for feedback to the user (e.g., success messages, error alerts).

**Development Tools:**

*   **TypeScript (`typescript`)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
    *   **Purpose:** Improves code quality, maintainability, and developer experience by catching errors at compile time.
    *   **Usage:** Your `.ts` and `.tsx` files indicate its use. Configured in `tsconfig.json`.
*   **ESLint (`eslint`, `eslint-config-next`, `@eslint/eslintrc`)**: A pluggable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript.
    *   **Purpose:** Enforces code style and catches potential errors.
    *   **Usage:** Configured in `eslint.config.mjs`. The `lint` script in `package.json` runs ESLint.

Now, let's look at your configuration files to see how these are tied together. I'll examine `next.config.ts`.

Read file: frontend/next.config.ts
The `next.config.ts` file confirms the integration of Sentry:

*   **`withSentryConfig`**: This higher-order function from `@sentry/nextjs` wraps your Next.js configuration.
    *   **Purpose:** To inject Sentry's build-time and runtime instrumentation into your Next.js application. This includes uploading source maps to Sentry for better error stack traces.
    *   **Usage:** It's conditionally applied based on the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENABLED` environment variable. Sentry options like `org`, `project` are configured here, typically drawing from environment variables.

**How they serve the purpose of Atomic Design, Reusability, Plug n Play, and Modularity:**

*   **Atomic Design:**
    *   **React** is fundamental, allowing you to build components as atoms, molecules, organisms.
    *   **Tailwind CSS** helps in styling these atomic units consistently.
    *   The directory structure (`src/components/ui`, `src/components/<feature>`) you've adopted directly supports this.
*   **Reusability:**
    *   **React** components are inherently reusable.
    *   **Props** (defined with **TypeScript** for clarity) make components configurable.
    *   **Zustand** allows business logic and state to be decoupled from components, making UI components more presentational and reusable.
    *   **`lucide-react`** provides a reusable icon set.
    *   Utility functions (often using `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`) for common tasks also enhance reusability.
*   **Plug and Play Approach:**
    *   **Next.js**'s modular nature (pages/routes, API routes) allows features to be developed and added somewhat independently.
    *   Well-defined component interfaces (props) mean you can easily drop components into various parts of the application.
    *   Libraries like **Sentry** or **`next-themes`** are designed to be integrated with minimal configuration.
    *   **Zustand** stores can be created for new features without impacting existing ones significantly.
*   **Modularity:**
    *   **Next.js**'s file-system routing (App Router) promotes a modular structure for pages and API endpoints.
    *   The organization of components into `ui` and feature-specific directories is a key aspect of modularity.
    *   **TypeScript** helps define clear contracts between modules (e.g., types for props, API responses).
    *   **ESLint** can enforce module boundary rules if configured.
    *   **`package.json`** explicitly defines module dependencies.
