Okay, here's a comprehensive plan for the assignment, focusing on a dynamic and scalable architecture as requested. This plan will be structured to guide the development of both the Low-Level Design (LLD) for the functional webpage and the High-Level Design (HLD) considerations.

## Plan for E-commerce Website Development

**Introduction:**
The goal is to develop a fully functional shopping cart website with a robust backend and a scalable cloud architecture. The tech stack will be React.js for the frontend, Node.js (with Express.js) for the backend, and AWS for cloud infrastructure. This plan emphasizes reusable components, abstraction, and scalability, while ensuring the initial LLD is precise and not over-engineered.

---

**I. Low-Level Design (LLD) - Shopping Cart Website**

**A. Frontend (React.js)**

1.  **Component Breakdown (Reusable & Modular):**
    *   **Layout:**
        *   `Header`: Logo, navigation links, cart icon, wallet balance.
        *   `Footer`: Copyright, links.
        *   `MainLayout`: Wraps pages with Header and Footer.
    *   **Product Browse:**
        *   `ProductListPage`: Displays a grid or list of products.
        *   `ProductCard`: Displays individual product information (image, name, price, add-to-cart button). Reusable.
        *   `ProductFilter`: (Optional, for future enhancement) Sidebar for filtering by category, price, etc.
        *   `SearchBar`: For searching products.
    *   **Shopping Basket:**
        *   `ShoppingCartIcon`: Displays item count, links to cart page. Reusable in Header.
        *   `CartPage`: Displays items in the cart, quantities, total price.
        *   `CartItem`: Displays details of a single item in the cart (image, name, price, quantity adjuster, remove button). Reusable.
    *   **Checkout Process:**
        *   `CheckoutPage`: Form for shipping details (simplified, no actual payment integration).
        *   `OrderSummary`: Displays items to be purchased and total amount before finalizing. Reusable.
        *   `CheckoutSuccessModal`: Confirmation message.
    *   **Wallet Implementation:**
        *   `WalletView`: Displays current wallet balance and transaction history.
        *   `TransactionRow`: Displays a single wallet transaction. Reusable.
    *   **Common/UI Components:**
        *   `Button`: Reusable button component with variants.
        *   `Input`: Reusable input field component.
        *   `Modal`: Reusable modal component.
        *   `Spinner`: Loading indicator.

2.  **State Management:**
    *   **React Context API with `useReducer`:** Suitable for managing global state like cart, user authentication, and wallet balance without overcomplicating for this scale. It avoids external dependencies for simpler state needs initially.
    *   Local component state (`useState`) for form inputs, UI toggles, etc.

3.  **API Interaction:**
    *   **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend. Create a centralized API service module (e.g., `src/services/api.js`) to handle base URLs, headers, and error handling.

4.  **Styling:**
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid UI development and utility-first styling. Ensures consistency and reduces custom CSS.

5.  **Routing:**
    *   **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side navigation (`/products`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/wallet`, `/login`, `/register`).

**B. Backend (Node.js with Express.js)**

1.  **API Endpoints (RESTful):**
    *   **Authentication:**
        *   `POST /api/auth/register`: User registration.
        *   `POST /api/auth/login`: User login (returns JWT).
        *   `GET /api/auth/me`: Get current user details (requires JWT).
    *   **Products:**
        *   `GET /api/products`: Fetch all products (with optional pagination/filtering).
        *   `GET /api/products/:id`: Fetch a single product by ID.
    *   **Shopping Cart:**
        *   `GET /api/cart`: Get the current user's cart (requires JWT).
        *   `POST /api/cart/add`: Add a product to the cart (requires JWT).
        *   `PUT /api/cart/item/:productId`: Update quantity of a product in the cart (requires JWT).
        *   `DELETE /api/cart/item/:productId`: Remove a product from the cart (requires JWT).
        *   `POST /api/cart/clear`: Clear the entire cart (requires JWT).
    *   **Checkout:**
        *   `POST /api/checkout`: Process the checkout (creates an order, updates wallet if applicable) (requires JWT).
    *   **Wallet:**
        *   `GET /api/wallet`: Get wallet balance and transaction history (requires JWT).
        *   `POST /api/wallet/deposit`: (Simplified) Add funds to wallet (for testing, not real payment).
        *   *(Internal: Wallet transactions will be logged during checkout or deposits)*

2.  **Data Management & AWS Integration:**
    *   **AWS PostgresSQL:** SQL database for storing:
        *   `Users` table: User credentials (hashed passwords), wallet ID.
        *   `Products` table: Product information (ID, name, description, price, image URL).
        *   `Carts` table: User's current cart items (UserID as partition key, ProductID as sort key or store as a list of items).
        *   `Orders` table: Order history (UserID, items, total amount, timestamp).
        *   `Wallet` table: User's wallet balance (UserID, balance).
        *   `WalletTransactions` table: Log of all wallet transactions (UserID, type (debit/credit), amount, timestamp).
    *   **AWS SDK for JavaScript v3:** Used in Node.js to interact with DynamoDB.
    *   **Dataset Generation:** A separate script (e.g., Node.js or Python with Faker.js/Faker) will be used to populate the `Products` table in DynamoDB with realistic dummy data.

3.  **Code Structure (Modular & Scalable):**
    *   `config/`: Database connection, environment variables.
    *   `routes/`: Define API routes, linking to controllers.
    *   `controllers/`: Handle request/response logic, call services.
    *   `services/`: Business logic, interaction with DynamoDB (e.g., `productService.js`, `cartService.js`, `authService.js`, `walletService.js`).
    *   `models/`: (Optional for DynamoDB, but good for defining item structures) Schemas or interfaces for data.
    *   `middleware/`: Authentication middleware (JWT validation), error handling.
    *   `utils/`: Helper functions (e.g., password hashing, JWT generation).
    *   **Integrations:** AWS SDK interactions will be encapsulated within service layers to keep controllers clean.
    *   **Constants:** A `constants.js` file within `config/` for application-wide constants.
    *   **Secrets:** Managed using environment variables (`.env` for local development). In AWS, these will be managed by AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager and injected into Lambda environments.

**II. High-Level Design (HLD) - Architecture & AWS**

**A. Core Architecture Components (Dynamic & Scalable):**

1.  **User Browser/Client (React App)**
2.  **AWS CloudFront (CDN):**
    *   Serves static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) from S3.
    *   Caches content closer to users, reducing latency.
    *   Provides HTTPS termination.
3.  **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
    *   Hosts the built React.js application (static website hosting).
4.  **Amazon API Gateway:**
    *   Acts as the single entry point for all backend API requests.
    *   Handles request routing to appropriate Lambda functions.
    *   Manages traffic, throttling, security (e.g., IAM auth, Cognito authorizers, API keys).
    *   Can perform request/response transformations.
5.  **AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute for Node.js Backend):**
    *   Each logical group of API endpoints (e.g., product-related, cart-related) will be a separate Lambda function, or a monolithic Lambda with internal routing (for simplicity in smaller LLD). Preference for more granular functions for better scalability and independent deployments.
    *   Executes backend code (Node.js/Express.js).
    *   Auto-scales based on demand.
6.  **Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL Database):**
    *   Fully managed, scalable NoSQL database for all application data.
    *   Provides low-latency data access.
7.  **AWS Cognito (User Authentication - Recommended for HLD):**
    *   Manages user sign-up, sign-in, and identity federation.
    *   Securely stores user credentials.
    *   Integrates with API Gateway for authorizing API requests.
    *   For LLD, a simpler JWT implementation within a Lambda can be used first, with Cognito planned as an upgrade.
8.  **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):**
    *   Defines permissions for AWS services (e.g., Lambda functions to access DynamoDB).
9.  **AWS CloudWatch (Monitoring & Logging):**
    *   Collects logs from Lambda, API Gateway.
    *   Monitors metrics for performance, errors, and invocation counts.
    *   Allows setting up alarms for operational issues.

**Diagrammatic Flow (Conceptual):**
`User -> CloudFront (React App from S3) -> API Gateway -> Lambda (Node.js) -> DynamoDB`
`User Auth: User -> API Gateway -> Cognito Authorizer (or Auth Lambda) -> Lambda (Node.js)`

**B. AWS Optimizations (Scalability, Resilience, Cost):**

1.  **Scalability:**
    *   **Serverless:** Lambda and API Gateway automatically scale with request volume.
    *   **DynamoDB:** Scales throughput capacity (on-demand or provisioned).
    *   **CloudFront:** Global distribution network handles high traffic for static assets.
2.  **Resilience & Availability:**
    *   **Multi-AZ:** Most AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway) are inherently multi-AZ or can be configured for it, providing high availability.
    *   **API Gateway:** Request throttling and caching can prevent backend overload.
    *   **Lambda:** Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for failed invocations to enable reprocessing or analysis.
    *   **DynamoDB:** Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) and on-demand backups.
3.  **Cost-Effectiveness:**
    *   **Pay-as-you-go:** For Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB (on-demand). Only pay for what is used.
    *   **S3:** Low-cost storage for static assets.
    *   **CloudFront:** Reduces data transfer out costs from S3 and improves performance.
    *   **Right-sizing:** Monitor Lambda memory and DynamoDB capacity to optimize costs.

**C. Deployment Choices (Write-Up):**

1.  **Frontend (React.js):**
    *   Build: `npm run build` to generate static files (`build/` directory).
    *   Deployment: Sync the `build/` directory contents to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
    *   CDN: Configure CloudFront distribution to point to the S3 bucket origin.
    *   Automation: AWS CodePipeline with AWS CodeBuild, or GitHub Actions, to automate build and deployment on code commits.
2.  **Backend (Node.js on Lambda):**
    *   **Framework:** AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or Serverless Framework.
        *   These tools simplify defining serverless resources (Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, IAM roles, DynamoDB tables) using YAML/JSON templates (Infrastructure as Code - IaC).
        *   They handle packaging the Node.js application, uploading it to S3, and deploying/updating the CloudFormation stack.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Write Lambda handler functions in Node.js/Express.js.
        2.  Define resources in `template.yaml` (SAM) or `serverless.yml` (Serverless Framework).
        3.  Use CLI commands (`sam deploy` or `serverless deploy`) to package and deploy.
    *   **CI/CD:** AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild or GitHub Actions to lint, test, build, and deploy the serverless application.

**III. Addressing Constraints & Key Considerations**

**A. Well-structured and Readable LLD Code:**
*   **Frontend:** Adhere to React best practices, component-based architecture, clear props, and state management patterns. Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
*   **Backend:** Follow the modular structure outlined (routes, controllers, services). Clear function names, consistent error handling. Use ESLint/Prettier.
*   **Video:** The code walkthrough video will highlight these structures, focusing on:
    *   Separation of concerns in frontend components and backend modules.
    *   How integrations (e.g., AWS SDK calls) are managed within service layers.
    *   Usage of constants and environment variables for configuration and secrets.
    *   Flow of data from API request to database interaction and back.

**B. AWS Service Integrations (No Dummy Responses):**
*   All backend operations (product fetching, cart management, checkout, wallet) will directly interact with DynamoDB via the AWS SDK.
*   Data for products will be pre-populated into DynamoDB using a script (AI/Faker for dataset creation as suggested is a good approach for this script).

**C. Choice of Auth for Integration & Speed/Security:**

1.  **LLD (Initial Implementation - JWT via Lambda):**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   User registers/logins via an auth Lambda function.
        *   Lambda validates credentials (against DynamoDB `Users` table), generates a signed JWT (JSON Web Token) containing user ID and roles/permissions.
        *   JWT is sent back to the client.
        *   Client stores JWT (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` - or `HttpOnly` cookie for better security if SSR or BFF pattern is used, but simpler for SPA initially).
        *   Client sends JWT in the `Authorization` header (Bearer token) for subsequent requests to protected API Gateway endpoints.
        *   A custom Lambda authorizer attached to API Gateway, or middleware in the main application Lambda, validates the JWT signature and expiry.
    *   **Speed:**
        *   JWT validation is generally fast (stateless, involves cryptographic signature check).
        *   Minimal overhead once the token is issued.
    *   **Security:**
        *   **HTTPS:** Essential. Enforced by CloudFront and API Gateway.
        *   **JWT Signing:** Use strong secret keys (managed via AWS Secrets Manager/Parameter Store for Lambda).
        *   **Short-lived Tokens:** Implement refresh token strategy if longer sessions are needed (more complex, can be deferred).
        *   **Protection against XSS/CSRF:** If using `localStorage`, be mindful of XSS. `HttpOnly` cookies offer better XSS protection.

2.  **HLD (Recommended Upgrade - AWS Cognito):**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Frontend integrates with Cognito Hosted UI or Cognito SDK for user sign-up/sign-in.
        *   Cognito manages user pools, credentials, and issues JWTs (ID token, access token, refresh token).
        *   API Gateway can be configured with a Cognito User Pool Authorizer to automatically validate JWTs from Cognito.
    *   **Speed:** Highly optimized by AWS.
    *   **Security:** Robust, managed service by AWS. Handles password policies, MFA, secure token storage and refreshment. Reduces custom security code and potential vulnerabilities.

**D. Guardrails for Service Degradation:**

1.  **API Gateway:**
    *   **Throttling:** Configure usage plans and API keys to set rate limits and burst limits per client or globally. Prevents abuse and overload.
    *   **Caching:** Enable API Gateway caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing GET requests (e.g., product lists) to reduce backend load and improve latency.
2.  **AWS Lambda:**
    *   **Concurrency Limits:** Set reserved concurrency to prevent one function from consuming all available concurrency in the account, impacting other functions.
    *   **Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts to prevent runaway functions.
    *   **Dead Letter Queues (DLQs):** Configure an SQS queue or SNS topic as a DLQ for asynchronous Lambda invocations. Failed messages/events are sent to the DLQ for analysis and reprocessing.
    *   **Retries:** Lambda automatically retries on errors for asynchronous invocations. For synchronous (API Gateway), the client should implement retries.
3.  **DynamoDB:**
    *   **Capacity Modes:**
        *   **On-demand:** Automatically scales, good for unpredictable workloads.
        *   **Provisioned:** Set specific Read/Write Capacity Units (RCU/WCU). Use DynamoDB Auto Scaling to adjust provisioned capacity based on actual usage.
    *   **SDK Retries:** AWS SDKs have built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors.
4.  **Frontend:**
    *   **Graceful Error Handling:** Display user-friendly messages for API failures.
    *   **Client-side Caching:** Cache some data (e.g., product catalog) in `localStorage` or state for a short period to reduce API calls and provide a better experience during temporary backend issues.
    *   **Optimistic Updates:** For actions like "add to cart," update UI immediately and then sync with backend. Handle potential failures by reverting UI or showing an error.
5.  **Circuit Breaker Pattern (Conceptual for HLD):**
    *   For critical downstream service calls from backend Lambdas, implement a circuit breaker (e.g., using a simple library). If a service repeatedly fails, the circuit "opens," and requests fail fast or return cached/fallback data, preventing cascading failures.

**E. Identifying Bottlenecks & Collecting Metrics for SLAs:**

1.  **AWS CloudWatch:**
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **API Gateway:** `Latency`, `Count` (requests), `4XXError` (client errors), `5XXError` (server errors).
        *   **Lambda:** `Invocations`, `Duration`, `Errors`, `Throttles`, `ConcurrentExecutions`.
        *   **DynamoDB:** `ConsumedReadCapacityUnits`, `ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits`, `ThrottledRequests`, `SuccessfulRequestLatency`.
    *   **Logs:**
        *   Enable API Gateway access logging.
        *   Lambda functions output logs to CloudWatch Logs (include request IDs, important parameters, error details in logs).
    *   **Alarms:**
        *   Set alarms on key metrics: e.g., high `5XXError` rate on API Gateway, high Lambda `Error` rate or `Throttles`, high `ThrottledRequests` on DynamoDB, Lambda `Duration` exceeding a threshold.
        *   Notifications via SNS (email, SMS, etc.).
2.  **AWS X-Ray:**
    *   Enable active tracing for API Gateway and Lambda.
    *   Provides end-to-end view of requests as they travel through services.
    *   Helps identify performance bottlenecks in the call chain (e.g., slow DynamoDB query, long Lambda execution).
    *   Generates a service map.
3.  **Defining and Monitoring SLAs:**
    *   **Example SLAs:**
        *   Product page load time (API response for product details) < 500ms (P95).
        *   Add to cart API success rate > 99.9%.
        *   Checkout API latency < 1s (P90).
        *   Overall API availability > 99.9%.
    *   **Monitoring:** Use CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize key SLA metrics. CloudWatch Synthetics can be used to create canaries that periodically test endpoints and user flows to proactively monitor SLAs.
4.  **Frontend Performance Monitoring:**
    *   Use browser developer tools (Lighthouse, Performance tab).
    *   Consider integrating a third-party Real User Monitoring (RUM) tool (e.g., Sentry, Datadog RUM) to collect performance metrics and errors directly from users' browsers.

---

**IV. Core Principles Applied**

*   **Reusable Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** As detailed in LLD section (e.g., `ProductCard`, `CartItem`, UI elements like `Button`, `Modal`).
    *   **Backend:** Reusable service functions (e.g., `getUserById`, `updateCartItem`), middleware for auth and error handling.
*   **Abstraction:**
    *   **Frontend:** Service layer for API calls abstracts HTTP logic. Custom hooks for reusable UI logic.
    *   **Backend:** Service layer abstracts data access logic (DynamoDB interactions are hidden from controllers). API Gateway abstracts the Lambda-based backend.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   Achieved via serverless architecture (API Gateway, Lambda), scalable database (DynamoDB), and CDN (CloudFront). The system is designed to handle varying loads automatically.
*   **Precise, No Overengineering (for LLD):**
    *   Start with essential features for the shopping cart.
    *   Use React Context API for state management initially.
    *   Simpler JWT implementation before moving to Cognito.
    *   Focus on core AWS services (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront). Advanced patterns (e.g., complex microservices, event sourcing) are avoided for this initial LLD but can be considered for future evolution based on HLD principles.

This plan provides a structured approach to meet the assignment requirements, balancing rapid development with a scalable and resilient architecture.
