Lead Software Developer
Assignment 1:
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to rapidly develop functional systems using
modern tools, while demonstrating a deep understanding of scalable and resilient architecture.
Rather than simply building a website, we’re interested in how you approach problem-solving,
make technical decisions, and leverage domain knowledge effectively.
We encourage you to use AI, open-source libraries, and existing codebases—but the key
evaluation criteria will be your choices and the reasoning behind them.
Do not hold back in HLD and your suggestions


Ask yourself:
● Why did you choose this particular tool or framework?
● How does your architecture support scalability and resilience?
● In what ways have you optimized for rapid development without sacrificing quality?
● How do your decisions reflect real-world constraints and priorities?

Techstack to be used :
1.Frontend : Any JavaScript Framework - [React.js]
2.BackEnd : Any fast development Framework -[Node.js]
3.Architecture - Cloud [AWS]

Problem Statement :

1. LLD[Fully Functional Webpage] :
    a. Create a Shopping Cart Website with
        i. Product Browse
        ii. Shopping Basket
        iii. Checkout Process [No Payment Required]
        iv. Wallet Implementation .
2.
    a. Components Required in a Architecture Diagram - Visual Representation
    b. Propose Optimizations using available AWS tools. - Visual Representation
    c. Deployment Choices - WriteUp

Constraints:

    1. Make sure the LLD code is well structured and readable[eg : integrations in one place ,Usage
       of Constants and maintain secrets] . - send a video to analyse the code structure and show few
       snippet to understand your flow of ideas.
    2. Use Integrations with AWS services and no dummy response , you can use AI to create DataSets.
    3. Explain the choice of Auth for Integration and how it makes your app fast /Secure
    4. Point out[Can be just a doc explaining] or implement guard rails in places to make sure
       we are safe at time of Service Degradation
    5. Explain [Can also be a writeup ] how you are gonna identify bottlenecks and collect
       metric to be effective for service Level SLAs
